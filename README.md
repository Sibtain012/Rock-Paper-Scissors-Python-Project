# ✊ Rock-Paper-Scissors - Python Game

Welcome to the **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game — a classic hand game implemented in Python using ASCII art and basic logic!

## 🎮 Game Description

This is a simple text-based version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game where you compete against the computer. Make your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer will make a random selection. The game then evaluates the outcome and announces whether you win, lose, or draw.

### Available Choices:

* `0` for Rock 🪨
* `1` for Paper 📄
* `2` for Scissors ✂️

The game includes fun ASCII art visuals for each option!

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

* How to use the `random` module
* Accepting and validating user input
* List indexing and conditional logic
* Printing multi-line ASCII art
* Handling invalid inputs
